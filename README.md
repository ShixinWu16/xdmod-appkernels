# Open XDMoD Application Kernels Module

The Application Kernel Performance Monitoring Module for Open XDMoD is designed
to measure quality of service as well as preemptively identify underperforming
hardware and software by deploying customized, computationally lightweight
“application kernels” that are run frequently (daily to several times per week)
to continuously monitor HPC system performance and reliability from the
application users’ point of view. The term “computationally-lightweight” is used
to indicate that the application kernel requires relatively modest resources for
a given run frequency. Accordingly, through XDMoD, system managers have the
ability to proactively monitor system performance as opposed to having to rely
on users to report failures or underperforming hardware and software.
